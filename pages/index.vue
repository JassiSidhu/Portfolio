        Based in Toronto, I am a software developer and Survey programmer with over 3 years of experience in programming user friendly online surveys and creating modern, responsive web sites. From informational websites to e-commerce solutions, I have a wide mix of skills to offer unique solutions. 
  <Br /><Br />
  My journey into becoming a software developer started back in 2010 when I decided to go for computer science engineering after completing my high school. I had the opportunity to learn wide range of subjects including various programming languages like C++, C# and other software fundamentals. I got to work on the college portal in PHP and MySQL which was selected in top ten projects at university level. After that, I joined a company as a Software Developer Intern where I enhanced the companyâ€™s website using PHP, JavaScript, jQuery and Ajax.
  <Br /><Br />
  In 2015, I attended Centennial college to take a program in Software Engineering where I learned various technologies like Advanced Java, Android, AngularJS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and many more. 
  <Br /><Br />
  Once I completed my studies, I was able to secure a Survey Programmer position at AskingCanadians which is also my current workplace. I program user friendly online surveys for company clients using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. As each client has different requirements, It is my duty to ensure 100% results for our clients as well as users taking those surveys.
  <Br /><Br />Apart from my technical skills, I am an organised and flexible person with quick learning capabilities and attention to detail.
